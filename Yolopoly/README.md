Monopoly is first designed in 1935 with the aim of pursuing players on investing on properties and managing their money to be the last one standing while pushing the other players to go bankrupt. There are 22 different locations that players can be bought and there are options to build houses or hotels for each of the properties in the name of rules. The game is based on rounds. Each player has to move to location where the sum of the dice rolled points.
